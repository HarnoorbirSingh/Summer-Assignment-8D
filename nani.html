            The day I arrived I was tired so I took a rest and slept for a couple of hours. Then in the evening, I practiced tying my turban. After 4 days it was weekend and then I went to a Gurudwara Sahib on Saturday and Sunday. I really liked the enviroment there and came to know more about a day in a village
