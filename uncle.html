            After the time I spent at my Nani's House, I will be going to my Grandfather's house to spent 1 week. It took me 3 hours to reach the destination. After I came to home I took some rest and after 2 days we went to The Golden Temple It was scorching hot there.Again after 2 days we went to a water park. It was really fun there.
