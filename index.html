    <h1>How I spent my <span>Summer Vacation</span></h1>
    <div>
        <h2>During my <span>Travels</span></h2>
        <p>During my travels, I went from Indore to Delhi by train as trains are a much more comfortable and cheap means of transportation. I traveled in 2nd AC and I got to see a nice view of the sunset too.</p><img class="train" src="download (1).jfif" alt="Sunset image">

        <h2>My days in <span>Punjab</span></h2>
        <p>The day I arrived I was tired so I took a rest and slept for a couple of hours. Then in the evening, I practiced tying my turban.</p> 


        <p>After 4 days it was weekend and then I went to a Gurudwara Sahib on Saturday and Sunday.</p>


        <p>This was my time spent in my Nani's house. Now I will be going to my Grandfather's house to spent 1 week. It took me 3 hours to reach the destination. After I came to home I took some rest and after 2 days we went to The Golden Temple It was scorching hot there.</p>

        <p>Again after 2 days we went to a water park. It was really fun there.</p>
